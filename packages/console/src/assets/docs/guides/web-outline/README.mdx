<Steps>

<Step title="Prerequisites">

[Outline](https://github.com/outline/outline) serves as a knowledge base for growing teams. To get started, you need an Outline hosting environment with access to environment variables.

Follow the steps outlined in the [Outline hosting guide](https://docs.getoutline.com/s/hosting/) until you reach the authentication configuration step. We'll leverage the Outline support of [OIDC-compatible authentication providers](https://docs.getoutline.com/s/hosting/doc/oidc-8CPBm6uC0I) in this guide.

</Step>

<Step title="Configure redirect URI">

Add a redirect URI by replacing the origin to your outline host origin.

<UriInputField name="redirectUris" defaultValue="[your-outline-origin]/auth/oidc.callback" />

For example, if your Outline is hosted at `https://outline.example.com`, the redirect URI should be `https://outline.example.com/auth/oidc.callback`.

Don't forget to click the **Save** button.

</Step>

<Step title="Set the outline environment variables">

Refer to the following table for the necessary configuration details:

<EnvironmentVariables />

Here's another table containing additional variables:

| Outline Environment Variable | Description                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| OIDC_USERNAME_CLAIM          | Set to `username`                |
| OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME            | Optional - customize as needed |
| OIDC_SCOPES                  | Keep default; no need to set   |

</Step>

<Step title="Set up email sign-in in Logto">

Since Outline requires user email to be provided, you need to configure email sign-in or a social sign-in that provides trustworthy email address, such as Google sign-in.

See [Passwordless sign-in by adding connectors](https://docs.logto.io/docs/tutorials/get-started/passwordless-sign-in-by-adding-connectors/) to learn more about configuring passwordless sign-in in Logto.

</Step>

<Step title="Checkpoint: Test Logto and Outline integration">

Start the Outline instance and access its endpoint. You should see a button in the center labeled "Continue with OpenID Connect"; it can be customized by setting the `OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME` environment variable.

<img alt="Outline sign-in page" src={outlineSignIn} width="360" style={{ borderRadius: '6px' }} />

Click on the button, and you will be directed to the Logto sign-in experience.

<img alt="Logto sign-in experience" src={logtoSignInExperience} width="360" style={{ borderRadius: '6px' }} />

If everything has been configured correctly, once you complete the sign-in or registration process in Logto, you will be redirected back to Outline. You can then see your personal information displayed in the bottom left corner of the page.
