Every organization scope is a part of the organization template.\n\nOrganization scopes will only be meaningful within an organization context. For example, a user may have a `read` scope for organization A, but not for organization B. See [üè¢ Organizations (Multi-tenancy)](https://docs.logto.io/docs/recipes/organizations/) to get started with organizations and organization template."
