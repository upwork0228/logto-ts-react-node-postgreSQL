Currently, Logto supports four types of applications:\n\n- Traditional web\n\n- Single-page app\n- Native app\n- Machine-to-machine app.\n\nDepending on the application type, it may have different authentication flows and access to the system. See [üîó Integrate Logto in your application](https://docs.logto.io/docs/recipes/integrate-logto/) to learn more about how to integrate Logto into your application.\n\nRole-based access control (RBAC) is supported for machine-to-machine applications. See [üîê Role-based access control (RBAC)](https://docs.logto.io/docs/recipes/rbac/) to get started with role-based access control."
