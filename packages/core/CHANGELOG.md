# Change Log

## 1.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 172411946: Add avatar and customData fields to create user API (POST /api/users)
- abffb9f95: full oidc standard claims support

  We have added support for the remaining [OpenID Connect standard claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims). Now, these claims are accessible in both ID tokens and the response from the `/me` endpoint.

  Additionally, we adhere to the standard scopes - claims mapping. This means that you can retrieve most of the profile claims using the `profile` scope, and the `address` claim can be obtained by using the `address` scope.

  For all newly introduced claims, we store them in the `user.profile` field.

  > ![Note]
  > Unlike other database fields (e.g. `name`), the claims stored in the `profile` field will fall back to `undefined` rather than `null`. We refrain from using `?? null` here to reduce the size of ID tokens, since `undefined` fields will be stripped in tokens.

- 2cbc591ff: support `first_screen` parameter in authentication request

  Sign-in experience can be initiated with a specific screen by setting the `first_screen` parameter in the OIDC authentication request. This parameter is intended to replace the `interaction_mode` parameter, which is now deprecated.

  The `first_screen` parameter can have the following values:

  - `signIn`: The sign-in screen is displayed first.
  - `register`: The registration screen is displayed first.

  Here's a non-normative example of how to use the `first_screen` parameter:

  ```
  GET /authorize?
    response_type=code
    &client_id=your_client_id
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &scope=openid
    &state=af0ifjsldkj
    &nonce=n-0S6_WzA2Mj
    &first_screen=signIn
  ```

  When `first_screen` is set, the legacy `interaction_mode` parameter is ignored.

- 468558721: Get organization roles with search keyword.
- cc01acbd0: Create a new user through API with password digest and corresponding algorithm
- 2cbc591ff: support direct sign-in

  Instead of showing a screen for the user to choose between the sign-in methods, a specific sign-in method can be initiated directly by setting the `direct_sign_in` parameter in the OIDC authentication request.

  This parameter follows the format of `direct_sign_in=<method>:<target>`, where:

  - `<method>` is the sign-in method to trigger. Currently the only supported value is `social`.
  - `<target>` is the target value for the sign-in method. If the method is `social`, the value is the social connector's `target`.

  When a valid `direct_sign_in` parameter is set, the first screen will be skipped and the specified sign-in method will be triggered immediately upon entering the sign-in experience. If the parameter is invalid, the default behavior of showing the first screen will be used.

### Patch Changes

- 7c22c50cb: Fix SSO connector new user authentication internal server error.

  ## Description

  Thanks to the [issue](https://github.com/logto-io/logto/issues/5502) report, we found that the SSO connector new user authentication was causing an internal server error. Should return an 422 status code instead of 500. Frontend sign-in page can not handle the 500 error and complete the new user registration process.

  ### Root cause

  When the SSO connector returns a new user that does not exist in the Logto database, the backend with throw a 422 error. Frontend relies the 422 error to redirect and complete the new user registration process.

  However, the backend was throwing a 500 error instead. That is because we applied a strict API response status code guard at the koaGuard middleware level. The status code 422 was not listed. Therefore, the middleware threw a 500 error.

  ### Solution

  We added the 422 status code to the koaGuard middleware. Now, the backend will return a 422 status code when the SSO connector returns a new user that does not exist in the Logto database. The frontend sign-in page can handle the 422 error and complete the new user registration process.

## 1.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 532454b92: support form post callback for social connectors

  Add the `POST /callback/:connectorId` endpoint to handle the form post callback for social connectors. This usefull for the connectors that require a form post callback to complete the authentication process, such as Apple.

## 1.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 32df9acde: implement Logto core API to support the new third-party application feature, and user consent interaction flow

  ### Management API

  - Add new endpoint `/applications/sign-in-experiences` with `PUT`, `GET` methods to manage the application level sign-in experiences.
  - Add new endpoint `/applications/:id/users/:userId/consent-organizations` with `PUT`, `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE` methods to manage the user granted organizations for the third-party application.
  - Add new endpoint `/applications/:id/user-consent-scopes` with `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE` methods to manage the user consent resource, organization, and user scopes for the third-party application.
  - Update the `/applications` endpoint to include the new `is_third_party` field. Support create third-party applications, and query by `is_third_party` field.

  ### Interaction API

  - Add the `koaAutoConsent` to support the auto-consent interaction flow for the first-party application. If is the first-party application we can auto-consent the requested scopes. If is the third-party application we need to redirect the user to the consent page to get the user consent manually.
  - Add the `GET /interaction/consent` endpoint to support fetching the consent context for the user consent page. Including the application detail, authenticated user info, all the requested scopes and user organizations info (if requested scopes include the organization scope).
  - Update the `POST /interaction/consent` endpoint to support the user consent interaction flow. Including grant all the missing scopes, and update the user granted organizations for the third-party application.

- 31e60811d: use Node 20 LTS for engine requirement.

  Note: We mark it as minor because Logto is shipping with Docker image and it's not a breaking change for users.

### Patch Changes

- 9222eb9f8: Set `on conflict do nothing` for all the `RelationQueries` insert operation.

  - For all the relation table entities, we want to safely insert them into the database. If the relation entity already exists, instead of throwing an error, we ignore the insert operation, especially on a batch insert. Unlike other resource data entities, user does not care if the relation entity already exists. Therefore, we want to silently ignore the insert operation if the relation entity already exists.

- becf59169: introduce Logto Organizations

  The term "organization" is also used in other forms, such as "workspace", "team", "company", etc. In Logto, we use "organization" as the generic term to represent the concept of multi-tenancy.

  From now, you can create multiple organizations in Logto, each of which can have its own users, while in the same identity pool.

  Plus, we also introduce the concept of "organization template". It is a set of permissions and roles that applies to all organizations, while a user can have different roles in different organizations.

  See [🏢 Organizations (Multi-tenancy)](https://docs.logto.io/docs/recipes/organizations/) for more details.

### Patch Changes

- b05fb2960: add summary and description to APIs

      {
        "id": "organization_id",
        "name": "organization_name",
        "description": "organization_description"
      }
    ]
  }

## 1.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 6727f629d: feature: introduce multi-factor authentication

  We're excited to announce that Logto now supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your sign-in experience. Navigate to the "Multi-factor auth" tab to configure how you want to secure your users' accounts.

  In this release, we introduce the following MFA methods:

  - Authenticator app OTP: users can add any authenticator app that supports the TOTP standard, such as Google Authenticator, Duo, etc.
  - WebAuthn (Passkey): users can use the standard WebAuthn protocol to register a hardware security key, such as biometric keys, Yubikey, etc.
  - Backup codes：users can generate a set of backup codes to use when they don't have access to other MFA methods.

  For a smooth transition, we also support to configure the MFA policy to require MFA for sign-in experience, or to allow users to opt-in to MFA.

### Patch Changes

- bbe7f0b8e: refactored swagger json api

  - reuse parameter definitions, which reduces the size of the swagger response.

## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 03bc7888b: machine-to-machine (M2M) role-based access control (RBAC)

  ### Summary

  This feature enables Logto users to apply role-based access control (RBAC) to their machine-to-machine (M2M) applications.

  With the update, Logto users can now effectively manage permissions for their M2M applications, resulting in improved security and flexibility.

  Following new APIs are added for M2M role management:

  **Applications**

  - `POST /applications/:appId/roles` assigns role(s) to the M2M application
  - `DELETE /applications/:appId/roles/:roleId` deletes the role from the M2M application
  - `GET /applications/:appId/roles` lists all roles assigned to the M2M application

  **Roles**

  - `POST /roles/:roleId/applications` assigns the role to multiple M2M applications
  - `DELETE /roles/:roleId/applications/:appId` removes the M2M application assigned to the role
  - `GET /roles/:roleId/applications` lists all M2M applications granted with the role

  Updated following API:

  **Roles**

  - `POST /roles` to specify the role type (either `user` or `machine-to-machine` role)

  **Users**

  - `POST /users/:userId/roles` to prevent assigning M2M roles to end-users

- 2c340d379: support `roles` scope for ID token to issue `roles` claim

### Patch Changes

## 1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- e8b0b1d02: feature: password policy

  ### Summary

  This feature enables custom password policy for users. Now it is possible to guard with the following rules when a user is creating a new password:

  - Minimum length (default: `8`)
  - Minimum character types (default: `1`)
  - If the password has been pwned (default: `true`)
  - If the password is exactly the same as or made up of the restricted phrases:
    - Repetitive or sequential characters (default: `true`)
    - User information (default: `true`)
    - Custom words (default: `[]`)

  If you are an existing Logto Cloud user or upgrading from a previous version, to ensure a smooth experience, we'll keep the original policy as much as possible:

  > The original password policy requires a minimum length of 8 and at least 2 character types (letters, numbers, and symbols).

  Note in the new policy implementation, it is not possible to combine lower and upper case letters into one character type. So the original password policy will be translated into the following:

  - Minimum length: `8`
  - Minimum character types: `2`
  - Pwned: `false`
  - Repetitive or sequential characters: `false`
  - User information: `false`
  - Custom words: `[]`

  If you want to change the policy, you can do it:

  - Logto Console -> Sign-in experience -> Password policy.
  - Update `passwordPolicy` property in the sign-in experience via Management API.

  ### Side effects

  - All new users will be affected by the new policy immediately.
  - Existing users will not be affected by the new policy until they change their password.
  - We removed password restrictions when adding or updating a user via Management API.

### Patch Changes

- ac65c8de4: ### Enable strict CSP policy check header

  This change removes the report only flag from CSP security header settings, which will enables the strict CSP policy check for all requests.

- 3d9885233: ## Bump oidc-provider version

  Bump oidc-provider version to [v8.2.2](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/releases/tag/v8.2.2). This version fixes a bug that prevented the revoked scopes from being removed from the access token.

  > Issued Access Tokens always only contain scopes that are defined on the respective Resource Server (returned from features.resourceIndicators.getResourceServerInfo).

  If the scopes are revoked from the resource server, they should be removed from the newly granted access token. This is now fixed in the new version of oidc-provider.

### Major Changes

- c12717412: **Decouple users and admins**

  ## 💥 BREAKING CHANGES 💥

  Logto was using a single port to serve both normal users and admins, as well as the web console. While we continuously maintain a high level of security, it’ll still be great to decouple these components into two separate parts to keep data isolated and provide a flexible infrastructure.

  From this version, Logto now listens to two ports by default, one for normal users (`3001`), and one for admins (`3002`).

  - Nothing changed for normal users. No adaption is needed.
  - For admin users:
    - The default Admin Console URL has been changed to `http://localhost:3002/console`.
    - To change the admin port, set the environment variable `ADMIN_PORT`. For instance, `ADMIN_PORT=3456`.
    - You can specify a custom endpoint for admins by setting the environment variable `ADMIN_ENDPOINT`. For example, `ADMIN_ENDPOINT=https://admin.your-domain.com`.
    - You can now completely disable admin endpoints by setting `ADMIN_DISABLE_LOCALHOST=1` and leaving `ADMIN_ENDPOINT` unset.
    - Admin Console and admin user data are not accessible via normal user endpoints, including `localhost` and `ENDPOINT` from the environment.
    - Admin Console no longer displays audit logs of admin users. However, these logs still exist in the database, and Logto still inserts admin user logs. There is just no convenient interface to inspect them.
    - Due to the data isolation, the numbers on the dashboard may slightly decrease (admins are excluded).

  If you are upgrading from a previous version, simply run the database alteration command as usual, and we'll take care of the rest.

  > **Note** DID YOU KNOW
  >
  > Under the hood, we use the powerful Postgres feature Row-Level Security to isolate admin and user data.

- 1c9160112: Packages are now ESM.
- 343b1090f: **💥 BREAKING CHANGE 💥** Move `/api/phrase` API to `/api/.well-known/phrases`
- f41fd3f05: drop settings table and add systems table

  **BREAKING CHANGES**

  - core: removed `GET /settings` and `PATCH /settings` API
  - core: added `GET /configs/admin-console` and `PATCH /configs/admin-console` API
    - `/configs/*` APIs are config/key-specific now. they may have different logic per key
  - cli: change valid `logto db config` keys by removing `alterationState` and adding `adminConsole` since:
    - OIDC configs and admin console configs are tenant-level configs (the concept of "tenant" can be ignored until we officially announce it)
    - alteration state is still a system-wide config

### Minor Changes

- c12717412: - mask sensitive password value in audit logs
- f41fd3f05: Replace `passcode` naming convention in the interaction APIs and main flow ui with `verificationCode`.
- c12717412: ## Creating your social connector with ease

  We’re excited to announce that Logto now supports standard protocols (SAML, OIDC, and OAuth2.0) for creating social connectors to integrate external identity providers. Each protocol can create multiple social connectors, giving you more control over your access needs.

  To simplify the process of configuring social connectors, we’re replacing code-edit with simple forms. SAML already supports form configuration, with other connectors coming soon. This means you don’t need to compare documents or worry about code format.

- c12717412: ## Enable connector method `getUserInfo` read and write access to DB

  Logto connectors are designed to be stateless to the extent possible and practical, but it still has some exceptions at times.

  With the recent addition of database read and write access, connectors can now store persistent information. For example, connectors can now store access tokens and refresh tokens to minimize number of requests to social vendor's APIs.

- 343b1090f: - Automatically create a new tenant for new cloud users
  - Support path-based multi-tenancy
- 343b1090f: Add storage provider: S3Storage
- 343b1090f: Allow admin tenant admin to create tenants without limitation
- 343b1090f: ### Add privacy policy url

  In addition to the terms of service url, we also provide a privacy policy url field in the sign-in-experience settings. To better support the end-users' privacy declaration needs.

- 18e3b82e6: Add user suspend API endpoint

  Use `PATCH /api/users/:userId/is-suspended` to update a user's suspended state, once a user is suspended, all refresh tokens belong to this user will be revoked.

  Suspended users will get an error toast when trying to sign in.

- 343b1090f: Add API for uploading user images to storage providers: Azure Storage.
- f41fd3f05: Officially cleanup all deprecated `/session` APIs in core and all the related integration tests.
- 343b1090f: **Add `sessionNotFoundRedirectUrl` tenant config**

  - User can use this optional config to designate the URL to redirect if session not found in Sign-in Experience.
  - Session guard now works for root path as well.

- 343b1090f: New feature: User account settings page

  - We have removed the previous settings page and moved it to the account settings page. You can access to the new settings menu by clicking the user avatar in the top right corner.
  - You can directly change the language or theme from the popover menu, and explore more account settings by clicking the "Profile" menu item.
  - You can update your avatar, name and username in the profile page, and also changing your password.
  - [Cloud] Cloud users can also link their email address and social accounts (Google and GitHub at first launch).

- 343b1090f: remove the branding style config and make the logo URL config optional
- c12717412: **Customize CSS for Sign-in Experience**

  We have put a lot of effort into improving the user sign-in experience and have provided a brand color option for the UI. However, we know that fine-tuning UI requirements can be unpredictable. While Logto is still exploring the best options for customization, we want to provide a programmatic method to unblock your development.

  You can now use the Management API `PATCH /api/sign-in-exp` with body `{ "customCss": "arbitrary string" }` to set customized CSS for the sign-in experience. You should see the value of `customCss` attached after `<title>` of the page. If the style has a higher priority, it should be able to override.

  > **Note**
  >
  > Since Logto uses CSS Modules, you may see a hash value in the `class` property of DOM elements (e.g. a `<div>` with `vUugRG_container`). To override these, you can use the `$=` CSS selector to match elements that end with a specified value. In this case, it should be `div[class$=container]`.

- 2168936b9: **Sign-in Experience v2**

  We are thrilled to announce the release of the newest version of the Sign-in Experience, which includes more ways to sign-in and sign-up, as well as a framework that is easier to understand and more flexible to configure in the Admin Console.

  When compared to Sign-in Experience v1, this version’s capability was expanded so that it could support a greater variety of flexible use cases. For example, now users can sign up with email verification code and sign in with email and password.

  We hope that this will be able to assist developers in delivering a successful sign-in flow, which will also be appreciated by the end users.
